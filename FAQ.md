###Q: What version does the mod use?

A: 1.7.10, and you need Minecraft Forge for 1.7.10 too!



###Q: Can I use this in a modpack or video?

A: Go right ahead, only if you put the appropriate credit ([link](http://parzivail.com/mods/tswm/) and a mention to Parzi's Star Wars Mod). Thanks!




###Q: Is this mod compatible with [server running tool or wrapper]?

A: The mod is compatible strictly with Minecraft Forge client and server.




###Q: I want to work with you guys what can I do?

A: If you have examples of your work somewhere public online and we see it and want to work with you, we'll contact you.  But we aren't necessarily looking for people to add to the team, sorry.




###Q: Will you be adding Clone Wars, Rebels, Old Republic, etc. content?

A: We will be adding as much content as our humble team possibly can.  That content will span across many different time periods and timelines.




###Q: Will you be adding AT-AT's?

A: AT-AT's might be a bit much in-game if we made them canon-correct size so we're gonna have to say a soft no on that for now.




###Q: Can you add flyable and fully explorable star destroyers?

A: The short answer is no, and the long answer is too long.




###Q: Speaking of new content when is the next update and what are you adding?

A: Go look at the Next Update Info tab on our site for info and a few small spoilers about new content.  As for when, we're always working so it's just whenever we feel the next release has enough content and is stable enough to be called a release that we actually put out a new version.  Sometimes (as with 1.3), we will choose to be publicly inactive for a while and work privately on a huge update which we will release without a timeline.  1.3 took about 4-5 months, so take that as an example of possible timelines.  **This does not mean we are not working, so please try to be respectful of how and when we push releases, because we are ALWAYS working on PSWM and have many future releases fully planned out, things just take time.**




###Q: Where are purple lightsabers and Jar Jar and Battle Droids and Clones?

A: Purple Lightsabers are in 1.3, but you're gonna have to wait for the other stuff.




###Q: Choose jedi or sith? Class system?

A: The Questing system in 1.3 allows for faction choosing.




###Q: Add Jedi and Sith NPC's and have them spawn and stuff!!

A: NPC's are tied to structures, so unless we have a Jedi Temple during the time of the Galactic Republic, you won't see any Jedi roaming the dimensions.  The Original Trilogy also only had 3 Jedi so the numbers just don't make sense for them to be mobs that spawn. (We're talking about movie-specific Canon here, not any new characters/information that has recently been introduced.)  As for Sith, there were only ever 2 Sith at a time and they were extremly hard to find so you probably won't ever see any Sith roaming around in the wild either.




###Q: Double lightsabers, pls?

A: 1.3 has multiple double bladed lightsabers to choose from.




###Q: Will this mod work with [some other mod]?

A: It should, but let us know if it doesn't and we'll add compatibility if it's a problem with our code.  If it's not our code causing the problem though, we can't really do anything to help, sorry.




###Q: 1.8/1.8.8/1.8.9/1.9/1.9.4/1.10?

A: Not right now.




###Q: Can I have a sarlacc pet?!

A: Definitely not, pits only.




###Q: Can you make the guns 3D?

A: All of the Original Trilogy guns are, any other guns still 2D are being 3Dified as soon as we care to.




###Q: How do you do/use "insert feature/action/mechanic"?

A: Take a look at our wiki, it'll probably clear some things up.




###Q: Why are ships "buggy"?

A: They're not, they just fly faster than most chunks can load/reload if you have your render distance set too high. Try turning down your render distance and start your flight above some area you've already loaded/played in.  A little frame drop should be expected, but if you have your settings right it shouldn't be noticeable.




###Q: Where are 3D armors and bosses for main character armors like Darth Vader and Kylo Ren?

A: Here's the thing.  3D armors take a lot of time because of all the things that have to happen for them to work correctly.  Not saying we don't want to, but that's a bit of a huge request especially for the amount of armors we have currently.  As for bosses, we aren't interested in doing boss fights as of the 1.3 release, but that could change, who knows.




###Q: Add Jakku and Starkiller Base and more Sequel Content!!

A: We have a lot of content across all of the trilogies planned, as we said earlier.




###Q: Lightsabers should deflect blaster bolts and make crashing noises when they hit another lightsaber that's blocking!!

A: They already do, we promise.




###Q: Lasers shouldn't catch things on fire, the lightsaber animation hurts my eyes, you shouldn't get water buckets from water droplets, and I keep getting weird Dimension ID crashes!!!

A: Look at our config file (`pswm-1.3.cfg` located in the `.minecraft/config/` folder), all of these things and more are optional and change-able on a per-user basis. *HOWEVER!* If your config file if different from the server's config file, bad things will happen. If this is true, contact your server administrator and ask them kindly for a copy of the config file.
